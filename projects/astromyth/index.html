<p><i>Astromyth</i> is a generative poster system inspired by astronomy (not astrology!) and ancient civilizations. The intention behind this project is to bridge the macro-level futuristic nature of space, with the micro-level nuance of the way we identify these celestial bodies through ancient human narratives.</p>

<p>Drawing from myths, white text gently overlays perlin noise that has been put to a grid, creating mosaics out of images of ancient figures and structures. Planets, moons, and stars gently swirl over the posters, lending a softer and more buoyant contrast to the structure of the grid.</p>
    
<p>Future iterations will include titles and more customized body text layers. Quotes from other mythic sources such as the Ancient Egyptian <i>Book of the Dead</i> will be incorporated as mostly-legible decorative elements. Another potentiality is to use astronomical data collected by NASA to create data points for the code to generate images and/or patterns from. I will also explore the possibility of generating the images of figures and structures, rather than collecting images to run through an array.</p>
