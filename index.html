                            <p><ul>
                                <li><u>In her essay, A Vernacular Web (2005), Olia Lialina describes the web of the mid-1990s as: bright, rich, personal, slow and under construction. It was a web of sudden connections and personal links. Pages were built on the edge of tomorrow, full of hope for a faster connection and a more powerful computer... it was a web of amateurs soon to be washed away by dot.com ambitions, professional authoring tools and guidelines designed by usability experts.</u> I'm a 90s kid and totally remember those days! My dad was always into new tech so my siblings and I were fortunate enough to grow up with computers when it was much less common. I remember games on floppy disks that would have to be accessed through MSDos; games that by the time I was in high school, TI-83 calculators were able to run. I remember figuring out the basics of html and css and designing websites about my favorite tv shows... choosing fonts and using bootleg editions of photoshop to make images. Geocities was a thing! I wish I had all of those old websites that middle-school-me made saved somewhere but I think they're backed up on hard disks that I wouldn't know how to access anymore.</li>
                                <li><u>"For example, M.D. Coverley's The Personalization of Complexity (2001) "explores the ways in which each of our personal computers have become idiosyncratic, individualized entities, only sometimes manageable by the owners."</u> My laptop, a 2014 Macbook which I've had for almost 8 years, is difficult to navigate now. I can't update it (the OS stops working entirely when I do) because I did something to the old OS when I tried getting it to connect to my newer iPad Pro a year or two ago. I have its Terminal application set up for coding and webdev in a way that I haven't done for my desktop, which I've had for less than a year. I also name each of my devices after fictional sidekicks, something I've done since I was a kid, so that it's easier to tell them apart on wifi or bluetooth networks. Despite that, I've occasionally thought of my relationship to technology but not in such personal terms; I think it's easier to imagine "shaping" a website than the hardware I'm working on itself.</li>
                                <li><u>In today's highly commercialised web of multinational corporations, proprietary applications, read- only devices, search algorithms, Content Management Systems, WYSIWYG editors, and digital publishers it becomes an increasingly radical act to hand-code and self-publish experimental web art and writing projects.</u> This is something I never imagined as radical but like... something I do because I'm too broke to hire someone to do it for me. On the other hand, this is also the reason I started re-learning to code in the first place; the potential of the web as a platform for more creative visual narratives is stunning, and I'm excited to learn more ways to bridge creative work with coding.</li>

                            <p><ul>
                                <li><u>It seemed like there was a type of "information should be free" ethos in how one would treat content and one's own practice in this time—an almost idealistic position, compared to today's customs towards sharing and copyright.</u> This is so interesting. How can you maintain that attitude and protect your work when major corporations will steal it, copyright it, and monetize it into oblivion? I've wondered how arts on the internet have mitigated that possibility. I guess, as the article later points out, NFTs counter that (if the artist is the one monetizing their own work).</li>
                                <li><u>I do think that in today's internet there is decreasing friction, which means people are being served content that platforms think they might be interested in rather than having to find content on their own, and this has actually detracted from the collective experience.</u> This part seems to fall in line with just how hard some politicians are trying to make web access more expensive and web content more policed and censored. Maybe we've been acclimated to that decreasing friction so much that it'll result in a more decisive halting of "freedom" on the internet.</li>
                                <li><u>The quote from Virgil Abloh, which came up a few days ago, summarises it nicely: "the process is the practice, the artifacts are just the side effects."</u> I love that quote. I'm not good at documenting process, so this feels motivating to make a more serious effort to share my work-in-progress, rather than things that are "done".</li>

                                <li><u>Two basic activities emerge. A person may work "on" the digital or "within" it. In the former, one's attention is directed from the outside in, taking the medium itself as its object, while in the latter one takes the perspective of the medium itself, radiating attention outward to other contexts and environments.</u> I never made this distinction before, though its interesting that the writer doesn't delve into the potentiality of overlap. I find divisions between the humanities and sciences to be arbitrary too. I may just be confused, though, as making these out to be separate approaches flattens the dimensionality of a reciprocity that seems natural to me: approaching the digital from the outside in <i>and</i> inside out. Maybe it's not the domain of art alone, then?</li>
                                <li><u>Are mathematicians modernists? Perhaps they are, given the way in which math tends to return continuously to its own formal construction.</u> Its "self-referential" formal construction was developed from contemplation of the (outward) natural world.</li>
                                <li><u>The true subject of the work is infrastructure—the cables and lines, the standards and protocols, all the industrial transfer technologies that reside in the space beyond the screen.</u> The Jodi site is wild. I like all the variety! Some iterations have a major Matrix vibe. That aside, I'm fascinated by structure as a focus of study. I appreciate that it's not a frequent subject for creatives to explore in the digital domain.</li>

                            <br><i>my meta tags include author, keywords, description, and viewport. my post metadata will be class # and date (my name would

                        <p>( e1 ) using html, how do you add idiosyncratic qualities to your page? how does it evolve over time?
