                                <li>I'm thinking of probably a very simple page so as not to distract from the posters themselves. There is also a very clean aesthetic to outer space. And as ancient sculptures are mostly housed in museums, a very simple display space makes sense to me.</li>
                                <li>Additional pages to add are an about page, explaining the project, a documentation page, for references and sources (particularly for the texts I use), and a gallery page, with example outputs.</li>
                                <li>As for typefaces, perhaps pairing a sans serif title with a serif for the body text will help create the sense of austerity it seems I'm going for.</li>

The software desires of designers, architects, and artists are often different from those of scientists, mathematicians, and engineers.</u> Beating this dead horse since 1760, but divisions of the humanities and sciences is a huge flaw of modern academia and an incredible failure of imagination. It's a choice, or inclination, to divorce logic from aesthetics, and linguistics have always been logical. The hindering that this quote refers to is just a long-term failure of fine arts education to approach the humanities and sciences more holistically.
                                    <!-- Putting aside how English-centric and Silicon Valley based modern tech is, even now, the Parsons CD program has an average of only one class per semester that involves coding in the context of design. So forget linguistics, or even multifaceted perspectives in general&mdash;I've never before been so inundated with the work of western white men, and that's taking into account that I have a degree in English literature. Yikes. So I'm getting off track, but my point is, this is a stupid excuse and also a lie. Just admit that art and design in the west have been so institutionally capitalistic, white, and male that applying radically different frameworks to didn't occur to more than five or six people whose work you recognize. And also maybe quit pretending to care about accessibility. -->

                                <li>I mostly focused on the imagery in this reading. The most difficult thing about conceptualizing a final generative project has been the subject. The next most difficult is the final result. The brief calls for doing something related to our field of study, but most of what's presented here seems purely aesthetic (rather than a specific product). I do appreciate that the text is mostly in black and white, though; I would have otherwise been much more distracted by color. Ultimately I'm very drawn to the work that involves lines, grids, and textures.</li>

                                <li><u>However tempting it may be to emply the computer for the generation of texts, computer poetry is undoubtedly the most difficult task of the computer in art. This is due to the fact that human language is the most complicated communication system that we know, just as the human brain, which creates and receives language, is the most complex system with which science has concerned itself until now. We are still far from understanding its function, and the exploration of language is also still in its embryonic stage.</u> Yes. Embryonic. I've thought about text generation for this project, but most poetry is already bad enough when it's human-generated. This would take way too long to be even minutely satisfactory when computer-generated. The examples (of which I read in English and German) on pages 134-137 reaffirm this belief.</li>

                                <li><u>The desire to form a common practice rather than a shared medium reflects the blurred nature of today's design practices and at the same time recalls the intermedia experiments, interdiciplinary design studios, and post-studio artistic practices of a previous era.</u> Any divorcing of the humanities and sciences is a conundrum of post industrial revolution western academia. For all the talk of letting go of the past, interdisciplinary approaches were the norm until more recently in history. Conditional design, as described here, is basically taking scientific method and applying it to design.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul>
                                <li><u>Although the rhetoric of decentralized authority pervades these endeavors, the question of control as an expression of authority (and design's role in it) lingers. It is not simply a question of no control or no design, but rather a question of where control and design happen in an open system.</u> If design can be considered an exercise in worldbuilding, authority as a major question in context of systems makes a lot of sense. The focus of the designer becomes the framework rather than any individual output.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul>
                                <li><u>This is the relational and conditional culture of contemporary design that seeks its progress not in the name of form or content, but in the myriad contexts that it both creates and to which it responses. In this environment, the if/then logic of the program replaces the binary nature of either/or dualisms.</u> I like that this moves conditional design from a question of certainties to a matter of speculation. The output itself becomes much less significant than the process, or more like the process <i>is</i> the primary output, which ties in well to the opening manifesto.</li>

                                <li>Overall, I really liked how this chapter introduced the potential of conditional design through a fictive scenario. It seemed grounded for the most part until the end, when Ong's conditional approach achieved a series of utopian solutions to real world issues. I would have appreciated at least one very grounded, detailed example of a solution to have been presented&mdash;it would have made this a much more persuasive argument to me&mdash;but I appreciate what it was going for nonetheless.</li>

                                <li><u>The most fantastic patterns were generated on the basis of simple rules such as 'choose the longest side of an existing triangle and add a triangle to it'. Ong had been very inspired at the sight of how a few simple rules could lead to unpredictable, layered, complex structures.</u> This is pretty much what we did in class.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul>
                                <li><u>The city should be seen not as a design but as a process in which time, mutual relations and change were the primary factors.</u> I wonder about how much of this concept is in interaction with urban planning. It makes sense to think of spaces, especially highly populated ones, as relational rather than concrete structures, but it seems like that approach is a little beyond where planning systems are currently at (just based off the infrastructure challenges and decay that currently exist in American cities).</li>

                                <li><u>Control is part of all games; making a game based on a concept is to express the concept in terms of control.</u> I do subscribe to the belief that parameters make conceptual work better. This is also interesting to me from a narrative standpoint (my background is in creative writing). All narrative requires "rules of the world" — the more realistic the narrative, the more the rules of the world are the same as those in the real world, but in magic realism or scifi or fantasy, those rules break. The writer still has to take care to maintain a set of "rules" for those more fantastical worlds so that a reader's suspension of disbelief can be maintained (among other things).</li>
                                <li><u>The making of patterns in physical configurations is as powerful a way to communicate as the word or other more formal was of representation. [...] The implications and meanings of patterns need not be more ambiguous than spoken language. Knowledge of patterns, however cannot be expressed without loss of content. Pattern knowledge is best conveyed by demonstration and imitation. It follows that games are good vehicles for studying the uses of patterns.</u> I never thought of games this way; but it's very true that without patterns, it'd be hard to determine a logic for the gameplay itself. I think this applies even to card and board games, and to the players, in the sense that they can choose moves in anticipation of another player's moves.</li>
                                <li><u>Any transformation game is a means to exercise skills in manipulating complex spatial arrangements. The division of responsibility increases the need for players to project alternative strategies, compare them and reach agreements, and then to coordinate their actions to implement their agreements about strategy.</u> This is what the above is in play for players. Without patterns in the rules of the game, they wouldn't be able to exercise these skills.</li>

                            <p><ul>
                                <li><u>In her essay, A Vernacular Web (2005), Olia Lialina describes the web of the mid-1990s as: bright, rich, personal, slow and under construction. It was a web of sudden connections and personal links. Pages were built on the edge of tomorrow, full of hope for a faster connection and a more powerful computer... it was a web of amateurs soon to be washed away by dot.com ambitions, professional authoring tools and guidelines designed by usability experts.</u> I'm a 90s kid and totally remember those days! My dad was always into new tech so my siblings and I were fortunate enough to grow up with computers when it was much less common. I remember games on floppy disks that would have to be accessed through MSDos; games that by the time I was in high school, TI-83 calculators were able to run. I remember figuring out the basics of html and css and designing websites about my favorite tv shows... choosing fonts and using bootleg editions of photoshop to make images. Geocities was a thing! I wish I had all of those old websites that middle-school-me made saved somewhere but I think they're backed up on hard disks that I wouldn't know how to access anymore.</li>
                                <li><u>"For example, M.D. Coverley's The Personalization of Complexity (2001) "explores the ways in which each of our personal computers have become idiosyncratic, individualized entities, only sometimes manageable by the owners."</u> My laptop, a 2014 Macbook which I've had for almost 8 years, is difficult to navigate now. I can't update it (the OS stops working entirely when I do) because I did something to the old OS when I tried getting it to connect to my newer iPad Pro a year or two ago. I have its Terminal application set up for coding and webdev in a way that I haven't done for my desktop, which I've had for less than a year. I also name each of my devices after fictional sidekicks, something I've done since I was a kid, so that it's easier to tell them apart on wifi or bluetooth networks. Despite that, I've occasionally thought of my relationship to technology but not in such personal terms; I think it's easier to imagine "shaping" a website than the hardware I'm working on itself.</li>
                                <li><u>In today's highly commercialised web of multinational corporations, proprietary applications, read- only devices, search algorithms, Content Management Systems, WYSIWYG editors, and digital publishers it becomes an increasingly radical act to hand-code and self-publish experimental web art and writing projects.</u> This is something I never imagined as radical but like... something I do because I'm too broke to hire someone to do it for me. On the other hand, this is also the reason I started re-learning to code in the first place; the potential of the web as a platform for more creative visual narratives is stunning, and I'm excited to learn more ways to bridge creative work with coding.</li>

                            <p><ul>
                                <li><u>It seemed like there was a type of "information should be free" ethos in how one would treat content and one's own practice in this time—an almost idealistic position, compared to today's customs towards sharing and copyright.</u> This is so interesting. How can you maintain that attitude and protect your work when major corporations will steal it, copyright it, and monetize it into oblivion? I've wondered how arts on the internet have mitigated that possibility. I guess, as the article later points out, NFTs counter that (if the artist is the one monetizing their own work).</li>
                                <li><u>I do think that in today's internet there is decreasing friction, which means people are being served content that platforms think they might be interested in rather than having to find content on their own, and this has actually detracted from the collective experience.</u> This part seems to fall in line with just how hard some politicians are trying to make web access more expensive and web content more policed and censored. Maybe we've been acclimated to that decreasing friction so much that it'll result in a more decisive halting of "freedom" on the internet.</li>
                                <li><u>The quote from Virgil Abloh, which came up a few days ago, summarises it nicely: "the process is the practice, the artifacts are just the side effects."</u> I love that quote. I'm not good at documenting process, so this feels motivating to make a more serious effort to share my work-in-progress, rather than things that are "done".</li>

                                <li><u>Two basic activities emerge. A person may work "on" the digital or "within" it. In the former, one's attention is directed from the outside in, taking the medium itself as its object, while in the latter one takes the perspective of the medium itself, radiating attention outward to other contexts and environments.</u> I never made this distinction before, though its interesting that the writer doesn't delve into the potentiality of overlap. I find divisions between the humanities and sciences to be arbitrary too. I may just be confused, though, as making these out to be separate approaches flattens the dimensionality of a reciprocity that seems natural to me: approaching the digital from the outside in <i>and</i> inside out. Maybe it's not the domain of art alone, then?</li>
                                <li><u>Are mathematicians modernists? Perhaps they are, given the way in which math tends to return continuously to its own formal construction.</u> Its "self-referential" formal construction was developed from contemplation of the (outward) natural world.</li>
                                <li><u>The true subject of the work is infrastructure—the cables and lines, the standards and protocols, all the industrial transfer technologies that reside in the space beyond the screen.</u> The Jodi site is wild. I like all the variety! Some iterations have a major Matrix vibe. That aside, I'm fascinated by structure as a focus of study. I appreciate that it's not a frequent subject for creatives to explore in the digital domain.</li>

                        <p>( e1 ) create an html page with 2 posts (1) your work share from last week (2) a new post this week.
                            <br><i>this is my new post!</i></p> 

                        <p>( e1 ) design an html structure for your post(s). try different html elements (imgs, tables, buttons, etc) to best represent the content you're sharing.
                            <br><i>the styling is fairly simple outside of the header. i've mainly been trying to get the "class" bookmarks to toggle more 
                            efficiently.</i></p>

                        <p>( e1 ) what metadata will you add? ( time, author, etc )
                            <br><i>my meta tags include author, keywords, description, and viewport. my post metadata will be class # and date (my name would 
                            be redundant with the header as it is).</i></p>

                        <p>( e1 ) using html, how do you add idiosyncratic qualities to your page? how does it evolve over time?
                            <br><i>the content can be organized differently in the future to contain more information over time.</i></p>

                        <p>( e1 ) upload your web page to github pages
